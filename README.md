# Leetcode

I will be going through leetcode problems to expand my critical thinking and tracking my progress through this repo

    
    Arrays -> Strings -> Linked List -> Trees -> Sorting and Searching -> Dynamic Programming -> Design


This repo is also used for me to practice my version control along with my dynamic programming.
These skills include commits, pull requests, issues, and branch control.
