__Definitions__ <br />
Internet - The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols. <br />
HTTP - HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with (space)(space)each other. HTTP follows a classical "Client-Server model" with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.<br />
